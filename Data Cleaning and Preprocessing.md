How do you handle missing data ? 
* Consider the nature of missingness
    * Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)
    * Missing at Random(MAR)
    * Not Missing at Random(NMAR)
* Options :
    * Remove rows with missing values
    * Impute with mean/median/mode

Explain data imputation
* It is a process of filling in missing values in a dataset.

What is data normalization ?
* Also known as feature scaling, is a preprocessing step.
* It involves transforming the values of different variablees into a similar scale or range.
* Methods:
    * Min max scaling - scales the data to a specific range.
    * Z score standardization - scales the data to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1
    * Robust scaling - scales the data based on the interquartile range to mitigate the influence of outliers.

How to handle Categorical data : 
* label encoding
* one hot encoding

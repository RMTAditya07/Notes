What is Central Limit Theorem? Why is it important in Statistics?
* The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution, as long as the sample size is large enough.
* This means that even if the data is not normally distributed, the distribution of sample means will tend to be normal.
* This is important because it allows us to make inferences about a population based on a relatively small sample. It forms the basis for many statistical techniques and hypothesis testing.

Explain the difference between Population and Sample?
* Population refers to the entire group of individuals or items that you're interested in studying. It's the complete set of all possible observations or data points that could be relevant to your research question.
* A sample, on the other hand, is a subset of the population. It's a smaller, manageable group selected from the population with the goal of making inferences or generalizations about the larger population.

What is p-value and how are they used in hypothesis testing?
* p-value is a statistical measure used to determine the strength of evidence of null hypothesis.
* In Hypothesis testing, it quantifies the likelihood of the observing the test statistc as extreme as , or more extreme than, the actual one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
* if p-value is small, we reject the null.

Define Correlation and Causation
* Correlation refers to the statistical Measure that describes the extent to which two or more variables change together.
* In other words, it quantifies the strength and direction of the linear relationhip between two continous variables.
* A correlation can be +ve, -ve or zero.
* Correlation does not imply causation.
* Just because two variables are correlated, it doesnt mean, change in one value changes the other.

* Causation implies cause and effect relationship between two variables.
* That is, change in one variable affects the other variable.

What is normal distribution and how do you test if a dataset follows one?
* Normal distribution also known as Gausian Distribution is a symmetrical probability distribution.
* its a bell shaped curve
* The mean, median and mode are equal
* The curve is symmetric around the mean

What is Standard Deviation?
* Standard Deviation is a statistical measure that quantifies the amount of dispersion or how much the data points are spread out there.

What is the difference between Descriptive Statistics and Inferencial Statistics?
* Descriptive Statistics aims to summarize and present data, providing a snapshot of what is observed in a dataset.
* Inferential Statistics involves using data to make predictions and conclusions.

Type I error : [Incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis]
* Also known as false positive, occurs when you reject a null hypothesis that is actually true.
* In other words, u conclude that there is a significant effect or relationshop when, in reality ,there is not.

Type II error : [Failing to reject a false null hypothesis]
* Also known as false negative, occurs when u fail to reject a null hypothesis that is actually false.
* In this case, u miss a real effect or relationship that exists in the data.
